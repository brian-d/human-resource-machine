## Naming Convention:

* **(floor).md** - A solution that solves both the speed and size optimization requirements.
* **(floor)-speed.md** - A solution that solves the speed optimization but not the size optimization requirements.
* **(floor)-size.md** - A solution that solves the size optimization but not the speed optimization requirements.
* **(floor)-bad.md** - A solution that works but solves neither optimization requirement.
